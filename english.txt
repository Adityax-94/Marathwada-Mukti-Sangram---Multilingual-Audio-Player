Marathwada Mukti Sangram Din is observed on seventeenth September every year.  
It marks the liberation of the Hyderabad State from the rule of the Nizam in nineteen forty eight.  
After India gained independence in nineteen forty seven, most princely states merged with the Indian Union.  
However, the Nizam of Hyderabad refused to accede to India.  
The Nizam wanted Hyderabad to remain independent.  
This refusal created political and security challenges for the new Indian government.  
Hyderabad State at that time included present-day Telangana, parts of Karnataka, and parts of Maharashtra.  
The people in these regions strongly opposed the autocratic rule of the Nizam.  
Movements demanding freedom and equality began to rise in rural and urban areas.  
In Marathwada, people organized themselves for the liberation struggle.  
Farmers, students, and workers all participated in protests.  
The Nizam’s private army, known as the Razakars, opposed these movements.  
The Razakars were infamous for violence and oppression.  
They carried out attacks on villages and suppressed dissent.  
Despite this, the people’s determination grew stronger.  
The people of Marathwada, Karnataka, and Telangana united in their struggle.  
Several underground groups were formed to resist the Nizam’s rule.  
Revolutionary leaders emerged to guide the masses.  
Many young men and women sacrificed their lives during this period.  
The people of Marathwada were particularly active in the struggle.  
They faced arrests, torture, and even death at the hands of the Razakars.  
Still, they did not give up their fight for freedom.  
The Indian government tried diplomatic efforts first.  
But the Nizam remained stubborn and unwilling to merge.  
As the violence in Hyderabad State grew, India had to act decisively.  
On thirteenth September nineteen forty eight, the Indian Army launched Operation Polo.  
It was a swift military operation against the Nizam’s forces.  
The operation lasted for just five days.  
By seventeenth September nineteen forty eight, Hyderabad State was liberated.  
The Nizam surrendered and agreed to merge with India.  
This was a turning point in the integration of princely states.  
For the people of Marathwada, it was the end of centuries of oppression.  
Villagers celebrated their new freedom with joy.  
Many martyrs were remembered with deep respect.  
Their sacrifices became a symbol of bravery.  
Marathwada Mukti Sangram Din was declared to honor this day.  
Every year, the state remembers the liberation struggle.  
The day is especially significant in the Marathwada region.  
Public meetings and commemorative events are organized.  
Leaders pay tribute to the martyrs of the movement.

The movement is seen as a continuation of the broader Indian freedom struggle.  
It reflected the spirit of unity among different regions.  
It also showed the courage of ordinary people against tyranny.  
Farmers fought with simple tools and courage against armed Razakars.  
Women played a crucial role by supporting and protecting activists.  
Many young people joined the struggle without fear of consequences.  
The sacrifices of these groups remain inspirational even today.  
Marathwada Mukti Sangram Din teaches the importance of unity.  
It reminds people of the value of freedom.

They also began to participate actively in nation-building.  
The movement created awareness about justice and equality.  
Land reforms and social reforms followed after independence.  
The liberation of Hyderabad ensured peace in southern India.  
It was one of the last major struggles of post-independence integration.  
Operation Polo is often described as a police action.  
But for the people of Marathwada, it was a liberation.  
The courage of local fighters is remembered more than the military aspect.  
Oral histories of the movement are still preserved in villages.  
Many families still recall stories of bravery from their ancestors.  
Some martyrs have memorials built in their honor.  
Statues and monuments remind the new generation of the struggle.  
The day is marked with flag hoisting ceremonies.
